    <p> Sup, I'm Nardos! I really enjoy nature-things like forests, mountains, thunderstorms, and animals catch my interest. I especially like horses for
        their strength and grace, and dogs for their loyalty and energy. I also love sports, especially football. The Premier League (EPL) and La Liga
        are my favorites. </p>

               Fun fact: They're total softies at heart despite the tough look!</p>
